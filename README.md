The Jet Brains IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Version is installed from your GitHub Student Package. You can find how to access your GitHub Student Package from the Lambda School Dashboard (using your own first name and last name)

[https://dashboards.lambdaschool.com/students/firstname-lastname/](https://dashboards.lambdaschool.com/students/firstname-lastname/)

We do need the Ultimate Version for the class. When installing, taking the defaults is the best way to proceed.

This video shows how your instructor has configured his IDE. You may have your own preferences.

Some notes on configuration:

* Under Code Folding, only the show Code Folding Menu should be checked
* All Braces placement should say Next Line
* All places should say Force Braces
* Only Annotations should be wrapped
* Remember to connect your GitHub profile to IntelliJ
